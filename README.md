# tado-influxdb
A little helper script to get measurements from Tado to InfluxDB.

## Config
Before running the script you must create a config.py (see config.py.example
for an example). The script will not work properly otherwise.

## Warning
Please be aware that this script is work in progress, does no error handling
and will probably crash ;-) I will fix this soon...ish!
